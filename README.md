# tagspace prototyping snaphots

First load
https://github.com/wagle/webextension-experiment-tags/tree/wagle-prototype-0001-snapshot-0001
as a temporary webextension in firefox nightly or developer edition.

Then load
https://github.com/wagle/tagspace-tng/tree/wagle-prototype-0001-snapshot-0001
the same way.

You should see a very simple sidebar with a list of all your bookmarks.  It
is too simple to do things like update, etc, though.
